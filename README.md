# My.Work()(;
- I'm a passionate C++ problem solving programmer with a strong foundation and hands-on experience in building real-world projects. I bring clean, efficient, and well-documented code to the table(CLEAN CODE) — perfect for your software needs💻🚀.
- Currently i'm at OOP course studying how to write a clean code with Mohammed Abu-Hadhud in his web platform PROGRAMMINGADVICES, I look forward to become a Full-Stack developer...Otherwise Back-end.
- CyberCuriosly interested in studying PENETRATION-TESTING & BINARY-EXPOITATION(purely offensive).
- CYBERSECURITY student in Umm Alqura university

- IMPORTANT: This repository is not to show you how i solve problems, It's to show you dazzling Solutions to some problems and also small projects...ENJOY;)
